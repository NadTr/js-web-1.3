# Welcome to the exercise 1.3 of Becode js-web

For this exercise, I use the Becode Template

To see the result on [GithubPage](https://nadtr.github.io/js-web-1.3/)



## The exercise:  **Super Vilain application form**
Display a form asking for the user's super vilain name, super power, motivation and plan to conquer the world.

The form should have two buttons, "Reset" and "Display". When clicking "Reset" it should erase the value of all the form elements to allow re-entering everything. When clicking "Display" it should erase the whole form and the buttons from the screen and display a text with headers showing the result collected in the previous form.
